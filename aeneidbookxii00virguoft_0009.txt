PREFACE

THE notes in this Edition are taken (in a slightly

abridged and revised form) from my edition of Vergil
prepared for the Cambridge University Press. I have
added a complete vocabulary3 and to the Introduction
(also revised and considerably abridged from the same
edition) I have appended a note on the metreâ€š explaining
the main points for the benefit of beginners, so as to

enable them to read with some understanding of the

poetic form.
