8 INTRODUCTJON.

empire; and after the century of civil wars and confusion, the new
order and peace made people feel that ‘a good time was come.'
The Georgics had shewn the genius of the young poet; and the
task proposed would appeal not only to his sowers, but to his
patriotic feeling.

This double object is conveniently and significantly summed
up in the opening passage. The poet sings ‘Arms and the
man '-—that is, a war-tale like the Iliad, and an adventure-tale
like the Odyssey3 but these adventures are endured with an
object—‘ till he should found a city, and stablish his gods in
Latium, whence rose the Latin race, the Alban fathers, and the
walls of mighty Rome.'

In pursuance of these two motives, which it is the aim of the
Aeneid to unite in a single poetic tale, Vergil is able on the one
hand to reproduce, in a Latin dress, the battle pieces‚ the sea-
adventures, the councils of the gods, the royal festivals, the
pictures of common life, the similes, which charmed the educated
Romans in Homer3 and on the other hand, to weave into his
narrative not only all manner of references to places, sanctuaries,
customs‚ local t1aditions, and memories, but also in the vision of
the future granted to the hero in Hades, and the pictures which
he describes as earved on the shield of Aeneas, to enshrine in
his national poem all the greatest names of Roman history and

legend.

the nephew of Priam king of Troy. At first he takes no part
in the Trojan war3 but being attacked by Achilles, afterwards
performs many heroic deeds for the Trojans. He escapes by
help of the gods when Troy is captured, and Homer clearly
conceives him as reigning at Troy after the departure of the
Greeks.

The later stories recount his wanderings about Europe after
the fall of Troy : and these Vergil adopts, making many altera-
tions and additions of his own. One great episode‚ his landing
