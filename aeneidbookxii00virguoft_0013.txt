at Carthage, and the love and desertion of Dido, was probably
in some shape traditional‚ though no doubt freely handled by
the poet.

The first book describes how Iuno, wroth against Aeneas
and his exiled comrades, prevented them long from landing in
Italy. When at length the fleet leave Sicily, Iuno causes a
storm on the sea, which scatters the fleet, and the exiles are
cast ashore at Carthage. Aeneas and Achates, rendered in-
visible by a cloud, approach the city. On a temple to Iuno
they find cai-ved the tale of Troy. Dido comes in, and
shipwrecked Trojans appear, begging help, which the queen
promises. Aeneas at last appears: all are invited to a banquet3
and Dido asks Aeneas to repeat to her the whole story of his
adventures.

In the second book he accordingly relates the sack of Troy
and his escape. In the third he continues the story, recounting
all his wanderings since he left the city, till he reached Africa.

Book IV. tells of the love, desertion, despair and suicide of
the Carthaginian queen.

The fifth book is an interlude, giving an account of games
held in Sicily, whither a storm drives them, on their way from
Carthage to Italy. At last however Aeneas departs‚ leaving
the weak and half-hearted behind, and reaches the promised

land.

Aeneas’ descent to Hades by the lake of Avernus near N aples,
where he meets his dead father, Anchises, who shews him the
souls of the future great men of Rome. He then emerges from
the realms below and rejoins his fleet (Book VI.).

Reaching at length the coast of Latium, he discovers by
a sign that this is his fated home. He sends to the king
Latinus to offer peace, which is at first agreed το, and Aeneas
is betrothed to Lavinia, daughter of the king3 but difficulties
arise, the gods interfere, and Turnus, king of the Rutules‚
who is a suitor of Lavinia, induces Latinus to join him in war
against the Trojans (Book VII.).

Aeneas meanwhile sails up the Tiber, and makes alliance
