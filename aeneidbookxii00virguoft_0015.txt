INTRODUCTJON. 11

(9) Line 587 The town in tumult, like a smoked bee-hive.

(10) ‚, 684 Turnus charging, like a loosened crag, sweeping
all before it.

(11) „ 701 Aeneas majestic, exulting, like Athos, EryX, or

Δ father Appennine.

(12) „ 715 Aeneas and Turnus meet, like two bulls fighting.

(13) „ 749 Aeneas chasing Turnus, hemmed in by the
town and marsh and foes, like an Umbrian dog
chasing a stag, barred by the river and the
scare.

(14) „ 856 Fury, flying to earth, like an arrow from a
Parthian bow.

(15) „ 908 Turnus' strength failing him in casting a stone,
like failing powers in a dream.

Besides these there is the simile of the sceptre (206) which
is in reality not a simile at all, but an oath.

In studying these similes, we see at once what they add to
the poem in the way of ornament. But ordinarily the point of
the comparison is obvious, as for instance (1) a roused warrior
like a ‘roused lion, or like a bull (3), or like Mars (4), or like a
North wind (5), or a sea-storm (6), or a loosened crag (10), or a
torrent (8), or again like bulls (12). Many of these would do
just as well in one place as another. There may be vivid or
beautiful details, and there often are ; e.g. the horses of Mars,
and the troop that attend on him, ‘the faces of black Horror,
Wrath, and Treachery’ (336) : or the swallow (474) ‘gathering
her little store of food for her chirping brood': or when the
dog ‘clings gaping to the stag's trail, and now all but catches
him, and snaps his jaws as though he held him, and is baffled
by the empty bite.’ But these details follow out the particular
picture conceived, and have often nothing to do with the thing
compared}> Sometimes the details are even positively irrelevant
or misleading : eg. Turnus driving alone in his chariot has no
accompaniment of Fear, Wrath, and Treachery: and nothing
can be less like Iuturna's object in dodging about her chariot
to escape Aeneas, than the swallow⁷s intent ‘to gather morsels
for her chirping brood.'
