This is what we may call the primitive use of the simile,
as it is employed in Homer, and imitated by many poets since.
They are adornments to the narrative and suggestive or
beautiful pictures3 and nothing further is aimed at.

P. Vergilius Maro was born 15 Oct, ΒΕ. 70, near Mantua,
a town on the Mincio in North Italy, then called Cisalpine
Gaul. He had not good health, and after being educated at
Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and studying Greek and
philosophy elsewhere, he came back to live (probably) on his
father's farm, until about B.C. 42. In that year Octavianus,
afterwards the emperor Augustus, had defeated at Philippi
Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of Julius Caesar3 and gave
lands to his victorious soldiers in various parts of Italy,
amongst other assignments being Vergil⁷s farm. The poet's
first acquaintance with Augustus was due to this event ; for he
applied to him at Rome for the restitution of his property, and
was successful. He became the friend of the rich art-patron
Maecenas, the poet Horace, and the brilliant circle of literary
men who were collected at the court of Augustus. The works
of Vergil are not voluminous. The Eclogues are Idylls in irni-
tation of the Greek poet Theocritus, and were written sometime
before he was 33. The Georgics, an agricultural poem in four
books, of which the form was more or less suggested. by
Hesiod, he wrote in the next few years, finishing them some-
time about his 4oth year. The Aeneid, his great work, he
appears to have begun about B.C. 27, when he was 43 years of
age, at the wish of Augustus. A few years later, finding his
health failing, he tried travelling3 and in the spring of 19 he
was at Athens. The summer he spent with Augustus abroad,
but died a few days after reaching Brundusium on his return.
The day of his death was Sept. 22, and he was not quite 51.
He was buried at Naples, where his tomb is still shewn, though
the authenticity of it is at least doubtful.
