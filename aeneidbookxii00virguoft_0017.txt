INTRODUCTJON

His character seems to have been most simple, pure, and

loveable ; and his poetic fame was well established even before
his death.

Note on tlte M'elre.

The Aeneid is written in the Hexameter verse, which is the
oldest known European metre and was probably used by the
Greeks as much as a thousand years before Christ. It is the
metre of Homer and the early Greek Epics 3 and was imitated
first in Latin by the Roman poet Ennius, who wrote his
Annales, a poem on the History of Rome, about the year
180 B.C.‚ more than a century before the birth of Vergil.

The metrical system is very simple, and can be explained in
a few words. The line consists of six feet, as the name implies,
and every foot must be either a dactyl (one long syllable fol-
lowed by two shorts) or a spondee (two long syllables). The
only exceptions to this rule are the following:

(1) The fifth foot must be a dactyl. (There are a very few
instances of what is called a spondaic line, i.e. a line where both
fifth and sixth feet are spondees3 but out of every thousand
lines in the Aeneid, not more than one such line can be found.)

(2) The last foot must be either a spondee (two longs) or a
trochee (long followed by short). (The only exception is the
very rare use of the overhanging syllable, called hypermeter,
which is explained below.)

Rule of E lz'sz’on.

When a word ends with a vowel, or syllable ending in m,
and the next word begins with a vowel, or vowel preceded by lz,
the last syllable of the first word is elided or cut off before the
second word. Thus in line 10 of this book we read ε

Tum sic adfatur regem, atque ita turbidus infit,
which must be scanned as if it were written

Tum sic adfatur reg' atqu' ita turbidus infit.
