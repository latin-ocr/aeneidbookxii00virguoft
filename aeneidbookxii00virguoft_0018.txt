This rule also has rare exceptions; chiefly after a pause, or in
the use of Greek words or names, where it seems natural to
employ a Greek license of metre‚ Thus, in this book we have ε

(line 31)—-Promissam eripui genero: arma impia sumpsi,
(and book i. line 617)—

Tune ille Aeneas, quem Dardanio Anchisae.

It should be noticed that elision only holds within the line 3
there is no elision between the end of one line and the beginning
of the next ; thus we have in line 15

...... spectentque Latini Ι et solus ferro,
and in line 16 ...... commune refellam : Ι aut habeat.

The only exception is the lzypermeler or overhanging syllable
referred to above3 this syllable always ends in a vowel, and is
always cut off before a vowel at the beginning of the next line ;
thus,

i. 332...ignari hominumque locorumque! Erramus...
vii. 160...turres ac tecta Latinorum 1 Ardua cernebant...

Rule of Caesara.

One of the most important points, and necessary to the
understanding of the metre‚ is the break in the line, or Caesura
as it is called. If, for example, we were to write a line like this:

agmina complent campos, lataque litora ponti

the metre would be quite right according to the rules given
above, but we should have a line quite impossible, for want of
caesura ; that is to say, there is no break between words except
at tlte end of a foot. A caesura is a break between words
occurring in the middle of a foot‚ as

ltali— Ι -arn fa· Ι -to profu· 1 —gus La· Ι -vinaque venit,

where there are three caesuras, in the second, third, and fourth
feet. The number varies; there may be as many as six, or
as few as two3 but the most important, and the commonest‚
caesura is that in the third foot, which is found in 97 out of the
