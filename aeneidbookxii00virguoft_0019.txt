first 100 lines in this book. The caesura in the second and
fourth feet is also very common ; and where the third foot has
none, the other two will always be found. Thus, in line 6 we
read:

Tum de· Ι -mum movet Ι arma le· Ι -o gau· Ι -detque co- Ι
-mantes

Again in line 63 we have
lumina: Ι nec gener' Ι Aene- Ι -an cap· Ι —tiva vi· Ι -deb0.

Here, however, though strictly there is no caesura in the third
foot, the effect of its absence is materially altered by the elision
which precedes. The same occurs in lines 85 and 90.

It will be noticed that the metrica] effect of a caesura is
quite different according as the break occurs aster the first long
syllable of the foot, or between the two short syllables of the
dactyl. The former is called the strong and the latter the
weak caesura. Thus, in line 7, Excutilens ce7‘3vz'ce tolros‚
fixlumque laltronis, the caesura in the second foot is strong,
that in the third is weak. In the third foot the strong caesura
is far the commonest 3 thuS, in the first hundred lines there are
84 strong and 13 weak caesuras in the third foot. The weak
caesura forms one of those numerous possibilities of minor
variation, on which in poetry so much depends. One more
point should be mentioned in regard to the ending of the line.
The Greek hexameter allowed the strong caesura in the fistlz
foot; Vergil only has it very rarely, and almost entirely when
he is using Greek names or borrowed words, like Neptuno
Aegeo, or manseram panaceam, or alboque orichalco. Ordinarily
he has in the fifth foot either no caesura or the weak one ; that
is, he has endings like volnere Ι pectus or Marte Latinos.
