NOTES.

[1—17. The Latins, disheartened‚ look to Turnus for aid. He
rises like a wounded lion and tells Latinus that the Trojans are cowards;
heis quite ready for the single combat3 let them settle the agreement]

1. ut, temporal‚ ‘when.’

infractos, ‘broken.’

2. defecisse, ‘ were disheartened.’

sua...se... being the first words of their clauses are emphatic5 ‘his
word now was claimed, lte was the centre of all eyes.’

promissa. In the last book Turnus had been taunted by Drances, .
who complained that their soldiers were being sacrificed to the personal
interests of one man, and had replied that he was quite ready to fight
Aeneas alone in single combat.

3. ultro properly means ‘beyond' and hence comes to be used,
especially by Vergil, for any feelings or acts not provoked or caused by
others, spontaneous, over and above what you might expect. For
instance ultro adloqui is ‘to speak without being spoken to’ as
opposed to ‘answering’ Here it might be rendered ‘himself‚’ i.e. he
needed no prompting.

4. Poenorum, ‘the Carthaginians‚' used here for Africa generally.
(vvis, not strictly used: he is thinking of the wastes or forests.

5. ille. This word at once draws attention to the lion (which we
should do with an adjective), and enables the poet to put leo emphatic
at the end, ‘That mighty lion.'

So XI. 493, Campoque potitus aut ille in pastus.

6. tum demum, ‘then at length‚' ‘then indeed‚’ demum being a
sort of enclitic used with demonstrative words.
