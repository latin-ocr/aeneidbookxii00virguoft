44 VERGJL. AEN. ΧΠ.

movet arma, metaphorical‚ ‘ prepares battle.'

comantes excutiens toros, lit. ‘ shaking the shaggy sinews‚’ a rather
bold variation for ‘the mighty mane?

7. latronis. The huntsman is called ‘robber’ from his stealthy
attack, probably.

9. ‘So waxed the kindling fury of Turnus.' Vergil draws him as a
violently passionate man.

10. turbidus, ‘wild.’ The root-idea of turba, turbo, turbare, is
‘confusion’ Compare the various meanings ‘crowd,' ‘ whirlpool,'
‘storm‚’ &c.

11. nihil est quod, ‘there is no reason why‚’ quod being used
relatively just as quid is interrogatively.

dicta. retractent, ‘they should take back their word.' The subj. is
indirect dubitative, the direct form being quid dicta retractent?

This line and the next shew Turnus’ violence and pride. The
‘coward sons of Aeneas' had not offered to ‘ shirk their covenant.'

13. congredior, forcible pres. for fut. ‘I go to face him?

sacra, ‘the rites' include all necessaries for the sacrifice.

concipe foedus, ‘ dictate the treaty.' The foedus was the agreement
that Lavinia should go to the winner. conci—fiere properly means ‘to
shape,' ‘to formulam? [Notice pater, with e long (as in old Latin it
used to be). Verg. only uses this license in the first syllable of the foot,
where the stress is.]

15. desertorem, ‘runaway.’

16. The ‘ common stain’ was cowardice and faithlessness‚ ν. 12.

17. cedat Lavinia conjunx, ‘let Lavinia become his bride‚’ cedere
regularly used of conquered spoil or captives (aurum, praeda, res,
captivi) passing into the victor’s possession. So ‘Andromachen cessisse
marito ² 111. 297. ’

[18—53. Latinus replies: Y ou have other realms: it is not fated
Lavinia should wed a countryman; Ι promised her to you, breaking
other pledges, and have suffered ever since: for all sakes forbear the
combat. Turnus wrathfully refuses, scorning the peril.]

19. animi might be Greek defining gen., or gen. of relation, so
common with adj. in Aeneid (aevi maturus, integer aevi, dives opum,
fessi rerum, ἃς.) : but animi occurs so often (in prose as well as poetry)
with verbs and participles, that it is probably a locutive use, ‘ in soul‚'
like lzumz’, domi, cordi, mattiae, Sec. Thus we find am'mz' angere (Cic.)‚
cruciare an. (Plaut.), fallit an. (Lucr.)‚ pendeo an. (Cic.).

feroci, ‘bold,’ ‘ proud.’
