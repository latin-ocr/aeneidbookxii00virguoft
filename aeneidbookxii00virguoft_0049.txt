NOTES. 45

23. ‘ Gold and good-will have I, Latinus, too’: i.e. 1 can compen-
sate you for your loss of kingdom and princess in other ways.

24. LaurenS, ‘ Latin‚' from Laurentum chief town of Latinus.

25. fatu. This is commonly called the supine in u. ⁴It is really
the ablatz've (the supine in um being the accus.) of a substantival steni
formed from the verb. Thus haud mollia fatu means ‘hard in the
saying‚' ‘hard to say‚' ‘unwelcome message.' (sine is imper. of sinere.)

27. Notice veterum in the sense of ‘ former.'

28. canebant, ‘declared’ (used of soothsaying, prophesying, divine
messages of any kind). ὓ

29. cog-nato sanguine, because Turnus was nephew of Amata wife

of Latinus.
31. genero, Aeneas, to whom the vacillating Latinus, following

the prophecies‚ had at first promised Lavinia. See VII. 98.

[Notice the hiatus: genero .· arma...]

35. spes Itala& ‘the hopes of Italy‚’ he means the fortunes of the
Latins, the phrase being poetic exaggeration. So elsewhere the
Trojan war is called ‘the conflict of two worlds': and again Troy is
called ‘the fortunes of Asia.'

37. referor, ‘drifting' [lit. ‘carried back,' i.e. change and change

again my purpose}
⁷ 38. 800105‚ i.e. the Trojans.

39. incolumi, abl. abs. (like T urno exstincto).

43. res 'bello varias, ‘war's chauces! This bello would in prose ·
be in bello or belli.

44. ‘ Whom Ardea, his distant home, now parts from us forlorn.'

46. ⁴ It wins its way more and more, and grows worse with cure.’

49. letum...pacisci‚ lit. ‘to agree to death for honour’: i.e. to die
so as to get honour. More naturally expressed in Aen. v. 230 vitam
pro laude pacisci, ‘barter life for honour.’ Here the poet inverts
the idea.

52. The quae-tegat clause follows just as if the previous clause
were negative, which in sense it is. ‘ His goddess mother will not be
near him to shelter him, &c.'

illi may be used with abest as with adest. Cic. has ‘ quid illi abest.’

[54—80. Amata detains and entreats Turnus to avoid the combat:
he is their only hope: if he is vanquished, she too will die, sooner than
be captive. Lavinia listens with tears and blushes ; but in spite of love

ῑ and entreaty Turnus clings to his honour and sends Idmon to bear his

challenge to Aeneas]
