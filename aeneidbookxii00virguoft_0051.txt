NOTES. 47

88. aptat habendo, ‘fits for the wear‚' habendo, dat.

89. ensemque, with e long. Vergil generally uses this license
(which is imitated from Homer, cf. Λάμπον τε Κλύτιόν τε, διο.) before
double consonants, as here ‘clipeum.'

cornua were two projeeting sockets in which the erest stood.

90. ‘ The god mighty with fire’ is Vulcan, of course.

92. columna. If the ablative is right, it is a rarer construction,
though possible, of adnixus: corfidere takes the same double con-
struction. So in English we ‘trust in' and ‘trust t0.’

94. Aurunci, an old Italian race belonging to the tribes inhabiting
S. Latium and Campania.

95. frustrata vocatus, ‘failed my l›idding.'

99. semiviri, ‘unmanly,’ cf. 12.

100. ‘Crisped with hot iron and dripping seent,' a most con-
temptuous line. Alurra, the truer Latin spelling of myrrha.

The Romans of Vergil’s day had a contempt for the feeble luxurious
and effeminate Phrygian: and this feeling is dramatically transferred to
Turnus.

102. scintillae absistunt, ‘the fiashes start': strong phrase, but
paralleled in many languages, in describing strong emotion.

103. prima in proelia, ‘to begin the combat.'

104. irasci in cornua (lit. ‘to rage into his horns’), a powersul
phrase translated from Eurip. Bacchae, 743, ἐς κέρας θυμούμενοι, de-
scribing the preliminary lowerings and thrustings of the head, so well
known in an angry bull. Construe: ‘and is fain to gather wrath into
his horns,’ or more simply ‘and butts with furious horn.'

105. lacessit, ‘vexes.’

106. sparsa...11a.rena, ‘pawing up the sand prepares the battle.’

[107—133. Aeneas prepares equally sor battle, eheers his comrades
and arranges the treaty. N ext day, the ground is measured, the altars
built, the hosts in full armour take their place, the old men and women
crowd the walls and towers.]

115. elatis, ‘lifted,’ as of a horse rising and eager.

118. ῑοοοε, ‘braziers' for the fire. ‘The gods of both’ being the
arbiters of the combat naturally have their altars in the midst.

120. limus is an obscure word, supposed to mean originally ‘slant.'
The word was used (as one of the many technical sacrificial terms) to
mean the ‘apron’ of the priest‚ from the waist to the feet, with a
‘slanting' band of purple. This traditional derivation seems very
doubtful, though the meaning ‘apron ' may be trusted.
