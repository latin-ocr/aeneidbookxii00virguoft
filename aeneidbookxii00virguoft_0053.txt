NOTES. 49

158. conceptum, v. ¹3·

159. auctor ego audendi, ‘I bid thee dare it.' The auctor is the
person who instigates, advises, is responsible, supports, confirms, ἃς.

[161—215. Aeneas and Latinus, each resplendent in his armonr,
advance to the altar. After sacrifice, Aeneas prays: ‘Sun and Earth
and Gods bear witness, if Turnus wins, we will retire to Evander’s city,
and make no more war: if I win, the races shall unite ⁴on equal termsss
Latinus then likewise swears by his sceptre‚ that whatever befalls
nothing shall impair'the treaty.]

161. reges has no verb, but it is subdivided into Latinus and
Turnus, each with his own verb. A very natural construction.

164. specimen, ‘token.'

avi in the wider sense, ‘ancestor.' The Sun was father of Circe,
who was wife of Picus, mother of Faunus: Latinus, son of Faunus.

170. An ornate way of saying ‘ a pig and a sheep ': V. often tries
thus to dignify the commonplace. The ‘unshorn’ sheep is fitter for
sacrifice.

17²· conversi lumina, ‘turning their eyes? The accusative is the
object acc. and the participle is practically a middle. Note that there
are two usages which Vergil adopts, no doubt without distinguishing,
(1) passive, like inteafusa genas, traiectus lora, (2) mz'ddle, like crines
gffusa, unum exuta pedem, pectus percussa.

This instance is the middle use.

173. The order was to sprinkle the sacred salt meal on the victim's
head ; then cut oh a loek from the brow [nolare‚ ‘to graze'], which was
th10wn into the fire; then to cut the victim’s throat and offer it.

179. The repetition of iam is eamest: ‘kinder now, now at last,
goddess, I pray.²

181. fontesque fluviosque, see 89, note.

182. ‘The sanetity of high heaven, and Powers of the blue main.’

183. fors, adverb. ‘If victory perchance attend.'

184. Euander, Arcadian hero, is settled (on the site of future
Rome) at a place called Pallanteum. He had formed alliance with
Aeneas.

185. cedet, ‘retire from.' [Observe three different meanings of
cedo in 148, 183, 185.]

187. nostrum is predicate.- ‘if victory grant the battle to our
hands,’ ‘make the day ours?

192. sacra deosque, ‘my gods and rites,’ sacra being the images
and censers and ceremonial utensils, as well as the ceremonies.
