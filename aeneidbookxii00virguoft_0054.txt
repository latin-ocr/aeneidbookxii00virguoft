50 VERGIL. AEN. XII.

193. socer, δῖα, ‘his arms, his kingdom due, let my bride’s father
Latinus keep.'

198. Latonaeque genus duplex, ‘the twin offspring of Latona'

199. ‘The nether powers and stem Pluto’s shrine’ : Dis or Pluto
is the god of Hades, or the lower world of the dead.

201. medios ignes et. numina, ‘the fires and divine powers between

umpires of the combat, and the altar was built z‘n the midst to symbolize

of birds, and dropping his prey escapes. Tolumnius exhorts them and
shoots at the foe, and the fight begins. Latinus flies. Messapus slays
Aulestes, Corynaeus Ebysus, and Podalirius Alsus.]

216. inpar, ‘ill-matched.'

videri. This use of infinitive is well known as the historic inf. As
its effect is to describe the action simply, without marking the order os
time, it is used wherever the time is not definite3 as either when the
action is rapid, act following act: or when feelc'ngs are described (as
here) which have no definite end or beginning: or when confused and
crowded scenes are depicted.

217. misceri implies confusion, ‘are troubled.'

218. non viribus aequis, ‘see them mearet, so ill-matched.’ The
