52 VERGJL. AEN. XII.

270. ut forte, see note on 488.

27 3. teritur alvo, ‘presses the waist'; lit. ‘is rubbed by.’

274. laterum iuncturas, ‘the edges of the ribs‚' i.e. the lower
edges, *ust where the belt would buckle. [Others take it of the belt:
‘grips the meeting lappets.’]

276. costas. The second acc. costas (aster horum unum) is an

irregularity. It is however quite natural, and the explanation is, that
the accusative has preceded, and expects (so to speak) an active verb

‘stabs,' for which the more detailed expression transadzgit costas is-
substituted. The construction is helped by fftndit, which picks up
the correct grammar again. Compare Χ. 698 Sed Latagum...occupat
os faciemque.

281. Agymnj are the rebel Etrurians (note on 2 32). Agylla, the

295· altus equo, ‘alost on his horse‚’ a natural extension of the
prose use of the ablative of the place where. Cs. 43.

296. hoc habet, ‘ vanquished‚’ ‘he has got it,' a vernacular expres-
sion (like our ‘you'll catch it,’ ‘ 1⁹11 give it you ⁷), common at Rome,
and especially used by the people in the circus when the gladiator
was hit.

298. ambustum, ‘charred.' Amb is the remnant of an old Latin
preposition ambz'z‘ around,' which only remains now in a few old
compounds—amburo, ambitio, ambages, ὅςας it is of course co. nected
with ambo, and literally is ‘on both sides!

300. occupat os flammis. The idea of occupare is ‘ sudden seizing'
(so as to anticipate your foe). ‘Dashed fire in his sace.'

301. super, ‘close after) [As we say ‘one thing followed upon
another. ’]
