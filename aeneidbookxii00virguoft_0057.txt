[31 1—382. Aeneas tries to stay the fight, but wounded by an arrow
from an unknown hand he retreats. Turnus, flushed with sudden hope,
jumps into his chariot and begins the fight. He tears along, like Mars
on the Thracian plain, and slays one after another. Eumedes he spies,
and spears him, and leaps out of his chariot, stabs‚ and triumphs over
the corpse: then drives again all before him, as a north wind the

waves and clouds. Phegeus, fired with vengeance‚ makes for his car;
¹but Turnus pierces him, rides him down, and cuts off his head.]
