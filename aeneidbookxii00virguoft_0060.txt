56 VERGJL. AEN. XII.

406. campis, abl. of place, cf. 43, note.

408. stare...pu1vere, ‘is stiff with dust‚' ⁶ a wall of dust,’ a forcible
phrase; stare lit. means ‘stands firm‚' as though the dust made the light
air solid. Similarly‚ VI. 300 stant lumina flammea, ‘ eyes set in a fiery
stare.’

411. indigno, ‘undeserved'; our use of ‘unworthy’ is slightly
different.

412. The dittany is a magie plant ; it had a ‘ stalk thick-clad with
downy leaves and purple blossom‚' and could heal a wound. Cicero
and Pliny both relate that animals when wounded ate it, and the

weapons fell out of their wounds. The name is connected by the poet,
and perhaps really, with Dicte in Crete. ‚

415. gramina, ‘ plant‚’ ‘herb’

417. fusum labris? splendentibus amnem, rather unusual words, as
Vergil’s wont is; simply ‘water drawn in a bright vessel.'

419. ambrosia (the ‘immortal' sood) and panacea (the ‘cure for
all'), two mythical herbs, which naturally were later identified with
several different existing plants. The names are Greek.

In this line Vergil introduces the Greek rhythm with great effect,
odoriferam l panaceam. See Introduction, Rule of Caesura, p. 14.

422. quippe, ‘ verily‚’ working the wonderful cure.

dolor, with 0 long, cf. 13.

stetit, ‘ was stayed,' ‘ was stanched.’

424. in pristina [lit. ‘into their old state']‚ ⁴ as before)

427. arte mag-istra, ‘ sovereign skilL'

429· maior, emphatic, predicative, ‘ 'tis the greater power of the
god that works.'

431· hinc atque hinc, ‘ on left and right!

433. armis may be from arma, ‘with armed embrace he clasps
him’: or from armi which (XI. 644) is used of a man. But the
mention of clipeus and lorica just before makes the first meaning more
probable.

434. summa. delibans oscula, ‘touching lightly his lips’ through
the vizor. Oscula is here in its original sense ‘lips‚' whence easily
comes the meaning ‘kiss.’

435. This beautiful line is imitated from Sophocles, who makes the
dying Aias say to his son ‘ Boy, be thou more fortunate than thy father,
but in all else like him)

437. ‘ Shall keep thee safe‚ and take thee where are great rewards.’
For defensum dabit compare placata α’(ιηί 111. 70, laxas dare Ι. 6 3.
