[441—499. Aeneas marches out with his troop3 the Latins see
him and Turnus flies in sear. Aeneas comes on like a sea-ward stoi-m
to land bringing fear and ruin. Many are slain, the Rutules fly: but

eluding Aeneas. Meanwhile Messapus hurls a spear at him, and grazes
his erest. Then Aeneas' wrath rises tempestuouS, and he mows down
