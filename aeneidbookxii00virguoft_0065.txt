NOTES. 61

seeing Turnus anywhere, thinks him dead, and in a frenzy of despair
hangs herself. Lavinia and Latinus are overpowered with grief]

595. tectis, ⁴ from the towers‚‘ with prospicit.

596. [incessi from incessere]

600. crimen. This phrase, where Vergil calls a person ‘the guilt ’
or ‘the fault ' when he means ‘the guilty cause.' is another instance of
how he stretches words to produce effect. ‘ That she was the source
and fount, the guilty cause of all their trouble.'

602. moritura, ‘resolved on death,’ cf. 55.

605. fioros... This quaint beautiful old word is the right reading
here; lit. ‘ her blossom—hair,’ i.e. ‘ lovely,' ‘ luxuriant.' The usual
reading is the ordinary word flavos.

609. demittunt menteS, ‘they despond,' usually animum demz'llo.

612—13. These lines are wrongly inserted here from book XI.

acceperit, adsciverit, causal subjunctives (after qui eausal).

[614—649. Turnus, flagging in the battle, hears the din of the city:
what is this? Iuturna replies, Leave the city to itself, and fight.
Turnus knows her through her disguise and passionately appeals to her,
whether he can allow, after all who have died for him, their homes to be
razed to the ground? Death is not so hard ; he will not be unworthy]

616. successu laetus equorum, ‘ exulting in his horses' prowess.’

617. Notice the imaginative expression ‘ Shouts mingled with dark
terror.' See 445.

618. arrectas (lit. ‘ pricked,’ metaphor from horses, &c.), ‘eager,’
‘ listening.’

621. diversa, ‘far‚' cf. 495.

625. ‘Meets him with these words‚’ i.e. replies to him. Either
Vergil forgets‚ or both Turnus and the charioteer occasionally take the
reins. In 327 Turnus manibus molz'lm· habenas, and there is no word
of a charioteer: in 469 the auregra is there, media inter lora ,· in 622
Turnus draws rein, though the false anrzgra (Iuturna) is there, equos et
lora regebat, 624. Probably the idea is the aurzgzz driving, and Turnus
from time to time impulsively seizing the reins.

626. prima, ‘earliest‚’ ‘speediest ἐ agreeing with victoria after
Vergil’s manner, instead of being an adverb. So 632.

627. possint, consecutive subjunctive, after qui, 84.

628. miscet, ‘ stirs up' (217, 445).

629. mittamus funera, ‘deal death.'

630. numero inferior, ‘less in the number of thy slain’ she must
mean.
