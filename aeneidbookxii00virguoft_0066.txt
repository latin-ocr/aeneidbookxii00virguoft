62 VERGIL. AEN. XII.

634. nequiquam fallis dea, ‘thou vainly hidest thy deity,’ lit. ‘art
unobserved as a goddess,' a Greek construction, λανθάνεις οὖσα θεά. The
present expresses the attempt, as frequently ε see 585.

637. nam quid ago? Here again we have forcible pres. for future
purpose as in line 13. ‘What can Ι do?' [So we say: ‘Does you1
mother go with you?’ ‘Do you start to-day?’]

638. The death of Murranus is told 529: and though no mention
is made of Turnus witnessing it, there is no difficulty in the statement
here that he did so. Both heroes were ‘raging about the field,' and
either may have seen anything.

639. superat, in the intrans. sense ‘is left.'

643. rebus, ‘my troubles.’

Drances (in the xlth book) had delivered a violent harangue against
Turnus, ascribing all their woes to his ambition and selfish disregard of
others3 cf. note on 2.

648. Every one will feel the effectiveness of this very bold metrical
license (the lengthening of ἅ in anima, before a hiatus too) in this grand
line, the climax of a superb passage...‘ Is death so hard? ye gods below
be kind, since Heaven has hid its face l a stainless soul I shall go down
to yom' &c [Mr Munro suggests ‘Sancta ad vos anima, al, atque istius,
&c.,' i.e. the insertion of the interjection al, which with another a on
each side might easily have dropped out.]

649. [N otice rare poetic genitive instead of ablative after z'n-
degum]

[650—696. Saces comes, wounded, to call Turnus. All look to
him, the queen is dead, defenders are few, while he is away. Turnus,
after conflict with himself, turns and sees the tower in flames. ‘ F ate is
master,' he eries, ‘I will fight and die, but first vengeance ! ' Then like
a falling crag, sweeping all before him, he rushes to the city walls, and
with hand and voice stays the fight.]

653. suprema salus, ‘ our last hope of safety.'

655. [Italum, gen. plur.]

exscidio daturum, see 256, 382, 464. This easy instance throws
light on some of the harder ones.

656. ora...oculos, rhetorical repetition, 135.

657. mussat, ‘doubts,' properly ‘to mutter,’ ‘to murmur,' and so
used of ‘uneasiness’ of mind. Cf. ΧΙ. 345, dicere mussant, where it
means ‘shrink,’ ‘ fear,’ and below 718.

658. vocet...flectat, dubitative (indirect).

659. tui fidissima, ‘most trustful of thee.' fidus prop. has dative,
