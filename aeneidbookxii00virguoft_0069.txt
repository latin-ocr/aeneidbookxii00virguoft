NOTES. 65

sentence (ni subeat) has truly no apodosis, though it is easily supplied
from deserit by the general sense. The sense is ‘the faithless sword
fails his eager stroke (and he would be helpless), did not flight aid him.'

734. ut, temporal, 1.

ignotum, because it was Metiscus’ sword, see below.

735. prima in proelia, ¹03·

737. dum trepidat, ‘in his haste.'

739. arma. Volcania. dei=arma Volcani dei, a Vergilian stretch of
phrase. Volcanus had made a shield for Aeneas, which is described at
length in book vm.

743. ⁴ Hither and thither winds in aimless maze.‘

744. corona, ‘throng‚’ used (by an obvious metaphor) in the circus,
Sco.

[746—790. Aeneas pursues him, like an Umbrian dog a penned
stag, Turnus calling for his own sword, Aeneas threatening death to any
who aids. Aeneas’ spear had stuck in a wild olive, sacred to Faunus,
which the Trojans had uprooted from the space they were clearing.
Turnus prays he may not be able to draw out his weapon, and long he
pulls vainly. Iuturna then gives Turnus his sword, and Venus, angry,
tugs out the spear. Once more the heroes rise, and face each other.]

750. ‘ Barred by the scare of the purple plume.'

It was a custom‚ in order to keep in the game in hunting‚ to erect
at the avenues of the wood bars with fluttering feathers 3 and this strue-K
ture was appropriately called formido, ‘a scare.’

753. viati, acc. cogn. 386.

Umber, dog of famous breed from Umbria. (As we say, without the
substantive, an Arab, a N ewfoundland, an Alderney.)

754. iam iamque tenet, admirably expresses the close race. It is
used to describe suspense of any kind, cf. 940.

761. The apodosis here too, as in 733, is grammatically wanting,
but practically contained in minatur exitium. Quisquam is used gene-
rally in negative senses; and here, as the general drift is the idea of
preventing anyone, it is natural.

762. saucius instat, ‘wounded, yet pursues.’

764. ‘No light nor bloodless prize‚' ludicra, such as are sought in
athletic contests or sport.

767. nautis olim venerabile, ‘revered of old by sailors’; naulis
is of course dat. depending on venerabile, as the dat. of the agent is

regularly used with gerundives and verbals in ·bz'lis: like ‘Nulli
flebiltbr quam tibi)
