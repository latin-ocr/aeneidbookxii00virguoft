817. ‘The one dread vow that is exchanged among the gods.'

820. tuorum, because Saturn‚ father of Jove, was also ancestor os
Latinus.

842. interea, i.e. in this state of mind, while her wrath is being

Iuturna heard and knew, crying: ‘ What more can I do for thee,
Turnus? forbear, ye Furies, I obey: is this Jove's gratitude for my
love? Why did he rob me of death, my only solace?' So saying with
a groan she fled to her river.]

845. Dirae, the Furies,
