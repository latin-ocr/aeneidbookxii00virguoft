This Series has been prepared in the conviction that
text-books simple in style and arrangement and written by
authors of standing are called for to meet the needs of both
pupil teachers and candidates for Certificates. Care will be
taken to combine a high standard of excellence with adapta-
tion to the practica] needs of those for whom the Series is
especially intended. To this end the general Editorship of
the Series has been entrusted to Mr W. H. WooDwARD‚ of
Christ Church, Oxford, now the Principal of University (Day)
Training College, Liverpool, and Lecturer on Education in
Victoria University. At the same time, it is believed that
most of the works comprised in the Series will be well suited
to the needs of Secondary and Public Schools.

Arrangements have already been made for the publication
in this Series of the following works :—

'A History of Education from the beginnings of the
Renaissance. By WILIJAM H. WoonwARD.
